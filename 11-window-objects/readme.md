# Window Object in JavaScript

The `window` object in JavaScript provides a global context for interacting with the browser's environment, controlling the browser's window, managing storage, handling events, and accessing various properties. Below is a detailed description of its properties, methods, objects, and events.

## 2. Window Object Methods

### Navigation
- **`open(url, name, specs)`**: Opens a new window or tab with the specified URL, name, and window features.
- **`close()`**: Closes the current window.
- **`stop()`**: Stops the loading of resources in the current window.

## 4. Example Code

```javascript
// Accessing Window Object Properties
console.log(window.innerWidth); // Viewport width
console.log(window.location.href); // Current URL

// Window Object Methods
window.alert("Welcome to the site!"); // Alert box
window.scrollTo(0, 500); // Scroll to position (x=0, y=500)
setTimeout(() => alert("Hello after 2 seconds!"), 2000); // Alert after 2 seconds

// Event Handling
window.onload = () => console.log("Page Loaded Successfully!");
window.onresize = () => console.log("Window resized!");
window.onscroll = () => console.log("Page scrolled!");
